# This message is used to switch the control scheme between force and position control. WARNING: When
# in position control, the IHMC balance algorithms will be disabled and it is up to the user to ensure
# stability.

# The enum value of the current high level state of the robot.

# A unique id for the current message. This can be a timestamp or sequence number. Only the unique id

# This message utilizes "enums". Enum value information for this message follows.

# "high_level_state" enum values:
uint8 WALKING=0 # whole body force control employing IHMC walking, balance, and manipulation algorithms
uint8 DO_NOTHING_BEHAVIOR=1 # do nothing behavior. the robot will start in this behavior, and report this behavior when falling and ramping down the controller. This behavior is intended for feedback only. Requesting this behavior is not supported and can cause the robot to shut down.
uint8 DIAGNOSTICS=2 # The robot is peforming an automated diagnostic routine
uint8 CALIBRATION=3 # Automated calibration routine depending on the robot. For Valkyrie: estimation of the joint torque offsets.
